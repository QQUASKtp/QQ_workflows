Perhaps the one shortcoming of MicMac is that the orthomosaic function (Tawny) does not blend the edges of the individual ortho-images. It relies on equalising  illumination across the tiles and on occasion, despite various parameter choices may not cut it due to radiometric drift etc. Bear in mind, most of the time it is fine - this dataset is slightly problemtatic in this respect.\n",
